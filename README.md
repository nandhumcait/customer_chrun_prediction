# customer_chrun_prediction
This project predicts customer churn — the probability that a customer will stop using a service — using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification.

The model helps businesses identify customers at risk and take proactive retention measures.

Customer churn significantly impacts business growth and revenue. Predicting churn in advance enables companies to focus retention strategies on high-risk customers.

Workflow

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing churn distribution and key correlations.

Feature Engineering – Creating meaningful features for better prediction.

Model Training (SVM) – Implementing SVM with different kernels (linear, rbf, poly) and tuning parameters (C, gamma).

Model Evaluation – Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
